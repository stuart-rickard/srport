              I'm very interested generally in how humans can use technology to improve their lives.  Specifically to coding, I love user interfaces that are highly intuitive for beginners and also provide a path for more powerful use that unfolds as the user spends time working with the interface.  I find these interfaces very elegant, and I really appreciate elegant coding also.

              For the past thirty years I have worked in the real estate development business, and I have been a real estate entrepreneur running my own business since 2003.  Real estate development has many aspects that are similar to software development: collaboration, creativity, and making a product, to name three.  Since I was a child, I've loved coding, but my career path led me to real estate until this time.  I'm very excited to be able to work in coding now.
